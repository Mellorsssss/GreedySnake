### GreedySnake
---

GreedySnake is a simple and naive game(it is actually my homework in Advanced Programming in C++), enjoy this!

### Build

Since GreedySnake is developed under VS, you shoould build it with VS.

### How to play?

There are two game modes in GreedySnake:
- **Basic Mode**: The head of snake and the wall have their colors.Once their colors are the same,the snake can move through the wall.
- **Infty Mode**: When the snake hit itself or the wall,it can restart--however,the 'body' will be in the place it died.
